# Your Parts

Before we can start building, we need to choose our parts and order them. The websites that were listed earlier are a good place to ask for help with parts. If you’re looking to make a part list, the best place to do that is a website called ****[**PCPartPicker**](https://pcpartpicker.com). There, you can take a look at other people’s builds and view some premade build guides you can try! Arguably, however, the best feature is the System Builder, this allows you to make a list of all the parts you want to use, it will compare all sites that have that part in stock, and find the cheapest price for each one.

Creating a part list can be a bit of trouble, as it’s hard not to overdo things and get the specifications to meet the standards you want, that's why it’s a good idea to post your build to one of these forums mentioned in the ****[**welcome chapter**](../), and tell them what your going to be using it for so they can help adjust your build to accurately satisfy your needs.

Sometimes, you will get an error while putting together your part list, sometimes the error is accurate but other times, it is wrong, for example, if you get an error saying something like _“Some \_\_\_\_\_\_\_ chipset motherboards may need a BIOS update prior to using \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.”_ Don’t worry, this error isn’t too much of an error, all that’s required is a BIOS update, which is incredibly easy to do, all you need is another computer, access to an internet connection and a USB flash drive.
