# Your Parts

Before we can start building, we'll need to choose our parts and order them. The websites that were listed earlier are a good place to ask for help with parts. If you’re looking to make a part list, the best place to do that is a website called ****[**PCPartPicker**](https://pcpartpicker.com). There, you can take a look at other people’s builds and view some premade build guides you can try! Arguably, however, the best feature is the System Builder, this allows you to make a list of all the parts you want to use, it will compare all sites that have that part in stock, and find the cheapest price for each one. PCPartPicker will also make sure that all of your parts are compatible with one another though it's best you do your own research to see which parts work with other parts.

Creating a part list can be a bit of trouble, as it’s hard not to overdo things and get the specifications to meet the standards you want, that's why it’s a good idea to post your build to one of these forums mentioned in the ****[**welcome chapter**](../), and tell them what your going to be using it for so they can help adjust your build to accurately satisfy your needs.

Sometimes, you will get an error while putting together your part list, usually the error contains helpful information but other times it doesn't help at all for example, if you may get an error saying something like _“Some \_\_\_\_\_\_\_ chipset motherboards may need a BIOS update prior to using \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.”_ This error should be something you should worry about, all that’s required is a BIOS update, which is incredibly easy thing to do.
