# The CPU

Take your CPU out of the box and then out of the plastic packaging.

{% hint style="danger" %}
Avoid touching the metal part on the top \(the heat plate\) and the pins on the bottom as if one of these breaks it could cause irreversible damage to your processor. 
{% endhint %}

Step one of installing your CPU is to push down the lever on your motherboard, pull it out and release. The retention plate or the black plastic covering the socket should pop out, then look on your CPU for the golden triangle on the corner, and rotate it to line it up with the golden triangle on your motherboard, then place it into the socket, no force is required, it should just drop in and place itself into place. 

The CPU should feel easy to install, if it’s not, it means you either haven’t lifted the retention arm or it’s rotated the wrong way. Next, we will push this plate down, while making sure that lever we pulled earlier is still in place. Then we lower the arm, pull it out and put it under the retention mechanism which we pushed the lever down from earlier. 

The plastic plate will become loose and pop out, take this plastic plate and keep it safe in your motherboard box, make sure not to throw any of your boxes away. The reason we keep the plastic plate is because in the event where we need to RMA our motherboard, they won’t accept it without that plate.
