# Air Cooling

Your CPU will also have a cooler included, if you chose a separate cooler when making your parts list, keep the stock cooler in the box in case you ever need to use it in a situation where you cooler might have died, however, if you just ordered the CPU and no separate cooler, the stock cooler should work fine. If you take a look on the bottom, you will see some pre-applied thermal paste that’s in a circle or a square, all coolers come with this paste, no extra thermal paste is required unless you’ve re-applied your cooler many times.
