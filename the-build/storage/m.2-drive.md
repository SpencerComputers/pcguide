# M.2 Drive

Locate your M.2 slots on your motherboard, next, hold your SSD up to it to ensure it fits in the slot you selected. Once you have confirmed it does, locate where you put everything that you took out of your motherboard box and take out a screw from one of the plastic bags. 

Now go ahead and put the screw in your mounting hole and screw it in with your hand as not much force is required for M.2 SSD mounting. As for your drive, it installs similar to laptop memory, you put the end with the golden bits into the slot and then push it down while we screw the mounting screw in all the way
