# The Motherboard

**Take your motherboard’s packaging which should still be boxed and place it in front of you, open it up and start taking everything out. Your motherboard should be at the bottom of the box, however some manufacturers will have it at the top. Take the motherboard out of the box and close it, take your motherboard out of the packet and place your motherboard on top of the box, this makes it work as a free, easy to use, test bench.**
