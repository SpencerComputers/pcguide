# The Motherboard

First, you'll need to remove everything from the motherboard box. Your motherboard should be at the bottom of the box \(though some manufacturers will have it at the top\). Take the motherboard out of the box and close it, take your motherboard out of the packet and place your motherboard on top of the box allowing you to use the motherboard mox as a work surface.
