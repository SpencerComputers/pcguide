# The Beginning

Make sure before starting anything, you have a clean, anti-static work surface. A kitchen bench or table will do, if it is metal, it’s good to have an anti-static working mat layered on top of it.

You will also need a phillips head screwdriver and an anti-static bracelet, the anti-static bracelet is to stop us from damaging the parts and the screwdriver is, to well, screw things into place, a magnetic parts tray, some cable ties and of course, some thermal paste.

{% hint style="info" %}
An alternative to an anti-static bracelet however is to take your power supply out of the box and flip the switch on the back to the off position, and plug it into the nearest power outlet, this means the power supply is grounded and whenever you move your feet or walk around, touch that to avoid any static electricity damaging your parts.
