# The RAM

Installing RAM is pretty easy and is probably the most risk free part of building a computer. Just push down the tabs on your DIMM slots and make sure you only push down the amount of sticks you have and that your ram is spaced out correctly. 

This information can vary from manufacturer of your motherboard, so it can all be found in the manual included. Take your sticks and line up the bottom parts with the DIMM slots, then place your sticks into the DIMM slots and push down on them. 

If you installed your memory correctly, the tabs on the sides of the slots should have popped back up and be secured again.
