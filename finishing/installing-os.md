# Required materials
For installing an operating system to your newly built PC, you'll need the following:
* USB Flash Drive (around 8-10GB should be enough)
* Keyboard
 * You may wish to use a mouse during the installation process (though it is not required).
* Monitor
* Another PC/laptop
# Choosing an operating system
Generally when choosing an operating system, you'll need to have a good understanding of what you're going to do with your newly built PC
## Windows 10
Windows 10 is usually the best choice for most computers since it is the most popular OS, has the most software available, and the most games avaliable.
## Linux
Linux is much less popular then Windows 10 and has less software support. Generally Linux is more meant for advanced users. If you don't know what Linux is, don't use Linux.
